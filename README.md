# Find and Fetch
Roughly 6.5 million pets enter shelters every year in America but only 3.2 million are taken home. A huge reason for this is because there’s not a reliable way for people to find the perfect pet for themselves.

Find and Fetch is a website that helps loving people find and fetch lovely pets. We ask people a series of questions to narrow down on their search and provide them with all the matches based on their preferences through our slick front end interface that we designed using Figma and integrated with HTML, CSS, and Flask. In our backend, we used beautiful soup to search the internet for potential fits and python to tie everything together. We smartly filter based on the preferences that the user gives us, so there are no unnecessary results. If they can’t find the perfect friend, we have a service via Twilio that allows the user to input their phone number and our algorithm will check everyday if there is any new match available and send you information via sms on them once we find it.

With Find and Fetch, pets up for adoption will not go unnoticed anymore and we can solve this issue of pets living without a warm and loving home!
